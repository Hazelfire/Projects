# C++ Calculator

A beginners C++ code. A basic calculator is a simple exercise, but functionality can continue to be expanded until you have something like a Ti-89 graphics calculator.

If you're looking to learn more about C++, you can fork this repo, make a feature branch,  and expand the number crunching capabilities of our C++ calculator.

## Feature Expansions

There are probably hundreds of things you can do but here's a list if you can't think of one.

1. ~~Calculator handles arbitrarily long infix equations.~~
2. Calculator remembers previous result [in progress...]
3. Can assign values to variables and use them later.
4. Can solve basic linear algebra equations.
5. Can output a GUI graph of a basic algebra equation.
6. Add a GUI numberpad interface.
7. so.. many.. more.. look up a Ti-89

#### How Compile And Run UnitTests

```bash
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
./runTests
```
